# FPGA_Alarm
 
Developed and implemented an alarm system using VHDL on a Nexys A7 FPGA board. Integrated a 4x4 Matrix keypad for user input. Employed Kicad to design a custom PCB for the project. The alarm system incorporated users to input a correct 4-digit password via the keypad, which was then displayed on a 7-segment display.
